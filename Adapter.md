The Adapter pattern is often used to make one interface compatible with another. In React, you might encounter situations where you need to adapt the interface of a component to work with a different set of props or methods. Here's an example of how you can use the Adapter pattern in React:

Suppose you have a legacy component that accepts a different set of props than what you currently have in your application, and you want to adapt it to work seamlessly. Let's create an adapter component to bridge the gap:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// LegacyComponent is a third-party component with a different prop interface.
function LegacyComponent({ name, age }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {name}</p>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// NewComponent is our adapter that adapts the prop interface.
function NewComponent({ fullName, years }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>New Component</h2>
      <p>Full Name: {fullName}</p>
      <p>Years: {years}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// Adapter function to convert props from NewComponent to LegacyComponent.
function adaptProps(props) {
  const { fullName, years } = props;
  return {
    name: fullName,
    age: years,
  };
}

function App() {
  // Data for NewComponent.
  const data = {
    fullName: 'John Doe',
    years: 30,
  };

  // Use the adapter to adapt props for the LegacyComponent.
  const legacyProps = adaptProps(data);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Adapter Pattern in React</h1>
      <NewComponent {...data} />
      <hr />
      <h2>Legacy Component</h2>
      <LegacyComponent {...legacyProps} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example:

1. `LegacyComponent` represents a third-party component with a different prop interface.
2. `NewComponent` is the component with the updated prop interface.
3. `adaptProps` is an adapter function that converts props from `NewComponent` to the format expected by `LegacyComponent`.

By using the `adaptProps` function, you can adapt the prop interface from `NewComponent` to match the expected props of `LegacyComponent`. This allows you to use `NewComponent` with the legacy component seamlessly in your React application.

The Adapter pattern is useful when you need to work with components or libraries that have incompatible interfaces, helping you maintain flexibility and compatibility within your application.
