In React, you typically manage state using React's built-in state management or state management libraries like Redux or Mobx. These methods already provide a way to ensure that there's only a single source of truth for your state.

However, if you need to implement a Singleton-like pattern within a React application for some specific use case, you can create a JavaScript module to hold your shared instance. This isn't a traditional Singleton pattern but rather a JavaScript module that is initialized once and shared across your components. Here's an example of how you might do this in a React application:

```jsx
// singleton.js
class SingletonService {
  constructor() {
    this.data = 'Some shared data';
  }

  fetchData() {
    return this.data;
  }
}

export default new SingletonService();
```

In this example, we create a `SingletonService` class that contains some shared data and a method to fetch that data. When we `export default new SingletonService();`, it creates a single instance of `SingletonService`, and this instance is shared across all modules that import it.

Now, let's use this Singleton-like service in a React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import singletonService from './singleton'; // Import the Singleton-like service

function ComponentA() {
  const sharedData = singletonService.fetchData();

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Component A</h2>
      <p>Shared Data: {sharedData}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

function ComponentB() {
  const sharedData = singletonService.fetchData();

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Component B</h2>
      <p>Shared Data: {sharedData}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Singleton-Like Pattern in React</h1>
      <ComponentA />
      <ComponentB />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, both `ComponentA` and `ComponentB` import and use the `singletonService`. This service is a JavaScript module that provides shared functionality and data, similar to the Singleton pattern concept.

Please note that this isn't a strict implementation of the Singleton pattern in React but a way to achieve similar behavior when sharing a single instance of a service or data across multiple components. In practice, you should prefer using React's built-in state management or other state management libraries when appropriate.
