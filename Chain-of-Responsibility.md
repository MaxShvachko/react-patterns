The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern where a request is passed through a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain. In React, this pattern can be applied to handle various actions or events.

Here's a simple example of the Chain of Responsibility pattern in a React application:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

// Handler 1: Checks if a number is even
function EvenNumberHandler({ number, onProcess }) {
  if (number % 2 === 0) {
    return <div>{number} is an even number (Handled by Handler 1)</div>;
  }
  return onProcess();
}

// Handler 2: Checks if a number is divisible by 3
function DivisibleByThreeHandler({ number, onProcess }) {
  if (number % 3 === 0) {
    return <div>{number} is divisible by 3 (Handled by Handler 2)</div>;
  }
  return onProcess();
}

// Handler 3: Default handler
function DefaultHandler({ number }) {
  return <div>{number} is neither even nor divisible by 3 (Handled by Default Handler)</div>;
}

// Chain of Responsibility
function ChainOfResponsibility({ number }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Chain of Responsibility Pattern Example</h1>
      <EvenNumberHandler
        number={number}
        onProcess={() => (
          <DivisibleByThreeHandler
            number={number}
            onProcess={() => <DefaultHandler number={number} />}
          />
        )}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  const [number] = useState(6);

  return (
    <div>
      <ChainOfResponsibility number={number} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, we have a chain of handlers (`EvenNumberHandler`, `DivisibleByThreeHandler`) that are responsible for processing a number. The `EvenNumberHandler` checks if the number is even and decides whether to handle it or pass it to the next handler (`DivisibleByThreeHandler`). The `DivisibleByThreeHandler` checks if the number is divisible by 3, and if not, it passes the request to the default handler (`DefaultHandler`).

This demonstrates how the Chain of Responsibility pattern allows you to create a chain of handlers that can handle requests in a structured and flexible way. You can extend this pattern to handle different types of requests or events in your React application.
