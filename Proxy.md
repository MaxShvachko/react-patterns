The Proxy pattern is used to provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. In React, you can use the Proxy pattern to add an additional layer of control or functionality to your components. Here's a simple example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

// RealSubject: The actual component
function RealComponent({ text }) {
  return <div>{text}</div>;
}

// Proxy: A component that wraps RealComponent and adds extra functionality
function ProxyComponent({ text, isAdmin }) {
  if (isAdmin) {
    return <RealComponent text={text} />;
  } else {
    return <div>You don't have permission to see this content.</div>;
  }
}

function App() {
  const [isAdmin, setIsAdmin] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Proxy Pattern Example</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setIsAdmin(!isAdmin)}>
        Toggle Admin Access
      </button>
      <ProxyComponent
        text="Sensitive information only for admins."
        isAdmin={isAdmin}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, we have a `RealComponent` that displays sensitive information. The `ProxyComponent` acts as a proxy for the `RealComponent`. It checks whether the user has admin privileges and only renders the `RealComponent` if they do. Otherwise, it shows a message indicating a lack of permission.

The `isAdmin` state is toggled by a button in the app, demonstrating how you can control access to the "real" component based on certain conditions. This pattern can be extended to perform other tasks such as logging, caching, or lazy-loading of components.
